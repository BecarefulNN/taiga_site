# Taiga - open-source corpus for machine learning



## We have gathered the resources with respect to popular NLP-problems:

- thematic modelling - news with theme tags, all the sites which provide rubrication (news, poems, prose)
- readability of texts - a popular science magazine NPlus1 has a readability metric for each text, provided by editor.
- NER and fact extraction - news with references to mentioned person’s page or wiki-information, news with personalia tags
- key-words extraction - news with key-word tags, hashtags on social media
- authorship attribution - all the texts with author information - magazines, news, and more important - social media - with gender, age, city, time and education mark-up.
- chat-bot training - open-source film subtitles 
- text generation - any resource depending on genre
- rare words studying, frequency dictionaries - literary magazines, social media
- morphological and syntactic parsers - any resource with respect to the genre

By now, 300 millions of words are 70% literary texts (33 literary magazines), 20% of news (Interfax, Fontanka, Lenta ru, Komsomolskaya Pravda, ) and 10% of other (popular science - NPlus1, culture - Arzamas, social networks - VKontakte, amateur poems - stihi.ru and prose - proza.ru), with crawlers available at https://github.com/TatianaShavrina/crawlers .
